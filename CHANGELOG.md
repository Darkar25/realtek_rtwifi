  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This is a mashup driver (experimental at this point)                          v0.2
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * First upload. will add more code/patches from upstream and so as-we-go.
    This kernel is based from the rtl8xxxu upstream, slightly modified to work as
    a standalone driver and not a kernel extension. Also, severan chipsets is added.
    
    A good first release. Enjoy!
